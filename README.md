# K-Means
This is my implementation of the K-Means machine learning clustering algorithm. It is written in Matlab and uses the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris to cluster different species of Iris flowers. It has the ability to change the number of K clusters and the ability to change the number of iterations ran. In the end of all the iterations, it calculates the Sum of Squared Errors so I have an indication of goodness in my clustering. I then can use this data to graph a knee plot which gives me a good visualization of how many clusters there truly is.
